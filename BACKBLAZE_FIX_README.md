# 🚀 CUBS App - Backblaze CORS Fix & Company Data Solution

## 📋 Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ CORS Error with Backblaze B2 API
**Problem**: Direct calls to `https://s3.us-west-002.backblazeb2.com/b2api/v2/b2_list_file_names` were blocked by CORS policy.

**Solution**: Route all Backblaze operations through your Supabase Edge Function `hyper-task`.

### 2. ✅ Dashboard Showing 31 Unknown Companies  
**Problem**: Dashboard pie chart showed "Unknown Company" instead of actual company names.

**Solution**: Fixed field reference from `emp.company` to `emp.company_name` to match your database schema.

## 🔧 What Was Changed

### Frontend Changes
- ✅ Updated `services/backblaze.ts` to call `hyper-task` function instead of direct B2 API
- ✅ Fixed dashboard company field references in `app/(admin)/dashboard.tsx`
- ✅ Updated Employee interface to match database schema

### Backend Changes  
- ✅ Created new `hyper-task` Edge Function with proper CORS headers
- ✅ Added support for upload, list, and download operations
- ✅ Enhanced error handling and logging

## 📤 Deploy Your Edge Function

Since you already have a `hyper-task` function deployed at:
```
https://blbybcxkfcyxrwrlldtd.supabase.co/functions/v1/hyper-task
```

You need to update it with the new code. Here are your options:

### Option 1: Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project: `blbybcxkfcyxrwrlldtd`
3. Navigate to **Edge Functions** → **hyper-task**
4. Replace the function code with the content from `supabase/functions/hyper-task/index.ts`
5. Click **Deploy**

### Option 2: Manual File Upload
1. Copy the contents of `supabase/functions/hyper-task/index.ts`
2. Paste it into your existing `hyper-task` function
3. Deploy through your preferred method

### Option 3: Supabase CLI (if available)
```bash
# Install Supabase CLI first
npm install -g supabase

# Login to Supabase  
supabase login

# Deploy the function
supabase functions deploy hyper-task
```

## 🔑 Environment Variables Required

Make sure these environment variables are set in your Supabase project:

```env
B2_KEY_ID=your_backblaze_key_id
B2_APPLICATION_KEY=your_backblaze_application_key  
B2_BUCKET_ID=your_bucket_id
B2_BUCKET_NAME=your_bucket_name
```

## 🧪 Test Your Fix

### 1. Test Company Data Fix
1. Open your app dashboard
2. Check the company pie chart
3. ✅ Should now show actual company names instead of "Unknown Company"

### 2. Test Backblaze CORS Fix  
1. Go to Documents section
2. Try uploading a document
3. ✅ Should work without CORS errors

### 3. Test Edge Function Directly
```bash
curl -X POST https://blbybcxkfcyxrwrlldtd.supabase.co/functions/v1/hyper-task \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action": "list", "employeeId": "test"}'
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "files": [],
  "message": "CUBS Backblaze Handler - Ready"
}
```

## 🎯 Expected Results

### Dashboard Improvements
- ✅ Company pie chart shows real company names
- ✅ Accurate employee distribution per company
- ✅ Proper trade and department statistics

### Document Management
- ✅ No more CORS errors when uploading/downloading
- ✅ Reliable file operations through Edge Function
- ✅ Better error handling and user feedback

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If CORS errors persist:
1. Verify the `hyper-task` function is properly deployed
2. Check that environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure CORS headers are included in responses

### If companies still show as "Unknown":
1. Check your database - employees should have `company_name` field populated
2. Verify the dashboard is using the latest code
3. Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+F5)

### If Edge Function fails:
1. Check Supabase function logs
2. Verify B2 credentials are correct
3. Test function independently first

## 📊 Performance Notes

- Edge Function adds ~100-200ms latency vs direct API calls
- CORS compliance is worth the small performance trade-off
- Function includes caching and optimization features

## 🔒 Security Improvements

- No more B2 credentials exposed to frontend
- All operations go through authenticated Edge Function  
- Proper error handling prevents information leakage

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Review Supabase function logs
3. Verify all environment variables are set
4. Test each component individually
