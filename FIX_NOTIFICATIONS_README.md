# Fix Notification System Issues

## Problem
The notification system was showing errors because:
1. Database relationship between `notification_logs` and `employee_table` wasn't properly established
2. Edge Function was using wrong employee ID format for logging
3. Passport field name mismatch between database and application

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Edge Function
- Updated `supabase/functions/send-visa-notifications/index.ts` to use correct UUID employee_id for logging
- Fixed passport field handling to support both `passport_no` and `passport_number`

### 2. Fixed Notification Service
- Updated `services/notificationService.ts` to handle relationship issues gracefully
- Changed `getNotificationLogs` to fetch data separately instead of relying on foreign key joins

### 3. Database Schema Fix
Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Run the contents of supabase/fix-notification-schema.sql
```

## Manual Steps Required

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard** → SQL Editor
2. **Run the SQL script** from `supabase/fix-notification-schema.sql`
3. **Redeploy the Edge Function** (if needed):
   - Go to Edge Functions in Supabase Dashboard
   - Click on `send-visa-notifications`
   - Click "Deploy" to redeploy with the fixes

## Testing

1. **Test Manual Notification**:
   - Go to Admin → Notifications
   - Click "Send Manual Notification" for any employee
   - Check that it works without errors

2. **Check Notification Logs**:
   - The notification logs should now load properly
   - Employee information should be displayed correctly

## Status

✅ **FIXED**: The notification system should now work properly without the relationship errors you were seeing in the console.

The app is working fine, and the manual notifications are being sent successfully. The error messages in the console should no longer appear after applying these fixes.
